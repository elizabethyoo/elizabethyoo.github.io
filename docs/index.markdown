## About Me üë©‚Äçüî¨

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student studying [Biostatistics](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am interested in developing **interpretable** and reliable **deep learning** methods for **digital phenotyping** and **precision health** applications, with the larger goal of democratizing health. Specifically, I am interested in analyzing continuously and **passively collected data** from personal digital devices (e.g. smartphones and wearables) to quantify and improve the quality of life of individuals suffering from cancer, mental health disorders, and other diseases. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jukka-Pekka Onnela](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/onnela-lab/). My Ph.D. is supported by the Harvard Prize Fellowship and the NIH T32 Cancer Training Grant. 

Previously, I obtained a master's degree in **Operations Research and Financial Engineering** from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). Before my master's, I worked as a Lab Manager at [Columbia Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute]("https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/). I completed a bachelor's degree in **Mathematics** from [Columbia University](https://www.math.columbia.edu/).

## Personal üßó

In my free time, I like to [rock climb](/pics/climbing.jpg). 

I also enjoy [hiking](/pics/hiking.jpeg), seeking new [dessert spots](/pics/dessert.JPG), and watching anime.
