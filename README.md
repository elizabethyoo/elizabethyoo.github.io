## About Me 

I am interested in leveraging statistical and deep machine learning methods to develop physician decision-making support tools, with the goal of democratizing access to healthcare. I am currently developing a deep neural net (DNN) framework with [Professor Niraj Jha](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/niraj-jha) that accurately and efficiently diagnoses mental health disorders using a small amount of physiological data collected from smartwatches.

Previously, I studied **Operations Research and Financial Engineering** at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu), where I focused on Bayesian optimization and inference methods to address problems in biological processes and healthcare.

I worked as a Research Assistant/Lab Manager at [Columbia Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute]("https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/).

I graduated with a degree in **Mathematics** from [Columbia University](https://www.math.columbia.edu/).
